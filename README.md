# Cs2ServerRoutine
Bash script to execute cs2 server and check for updates

Modify the script according to your needs! Add the discord Webhook and GLST token for the server and check all the folders to execute your server.

The script will stop the screen on any update ( but recommend use of the AutoUpdater ) and add a cronjob to run the script for a certain period of time.
